# ‚ú® Frontend Snippets & Code Experiments

This repository collects small-scale front-end projects and experiments originally built on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or similar platforms. These snippets reflect my exploration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî focusing on layout design, interactivity, animation, and digital storytelling.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- HTML5 & Semantic Structure  
- CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM interaction, logic flow)  
- Responsive design practices  
- Custom buttons, cards, headers, and layout components  

---

## üß™ Purpose & Learning Focus

This repo is intended as a **sandbox for experimentation and learning**. While not full-scale applications, these code snippets demonstrate:

- Comfort working with raw front-end code  
- Attention to layout and user experience  
- Aesthetic intuition and storytelling principles  
- Willingness to iterate, tweak, and test browser-based behaviors

Some of these projects were inspired by or adapted from The Odin Project curriculum ‚Äî a self-paced web development course that emphasizes practical, hands-on coding. While I haven't completed the full program, I‚Äôve used selected exercises to strengthen my understanding of front-end fundamentals and experiment with design variations on my own.

## üå± What's Next

I plan to continue adding to this repository as I experiment with design systems, responsive techniques, and accessibility improvements. This is a living collection and not meant to represent polished production-level code.

## üëÄ Why Keep This Public?

- Shows initiative and willingness to learn outside of formal work
- Demonstrates foundational comfort with front-end structure and syntax
- Highlights design instincts and visual storytelling ‚Äî especially important in science communication or digital reporting roles
