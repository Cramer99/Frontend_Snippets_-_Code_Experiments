# ✨ Frontend Snippets & Code Experiments

This repo contains front-end projects and experiments inspired by The Odin Project and CodePen [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) — showing my journey exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Semantic HTML structure  
- CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)  
- Interactive enhancements with Vanilla JS  
- Responsive, accessible UI components  
- Design + storytelling intuition 

---

## 🧪 Purpose & Learning Focus

This repo is intended as a **sandbox for experimentation and learning**. While not full-scale applications, these code snippets demonstrate:

- Comfort working with raw front-end code  
- Attention to layout and user experience  
- Aesthetic intuition and storytelling principles  
- Willingness to iterate, tweak, and test browser-based behaviors

Some of these projects were inspired by or adapted from The Odin Project curriculum — a self-paced web development course that emphasizes practical, hands-on coding. While I haven't completed the full program, I’ve used selected exercises to strengthen my understanding of front-end fundamentals and experiment with design variations on my own.

## 🌱 What's Next

I plan to continue adding to this repository as I experiment with design systems, responsive techniques, and accessibility improvements. This is a living collection and not meant to represent polished production-level code.

## 👀 Why Keep This Public?

- Shows initiative and willingness to learn outside of formal work
- Demonstrates foundational comfort with front-end structure and syntax
- Highlights design instincts and visual storytelling — especially important in science communication or digital reporting roles
